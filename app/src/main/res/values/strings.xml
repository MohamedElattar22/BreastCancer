    <string name="paragraph">● Use your affected arm (on the same side as your surgery) as you normally would when you comb your hair, bathe, get dressed, and eat. Be sure to ask your doctor if you can lift heavier items. \n ● Raise your arms up to shoulder height, or whatever height you can without pulling on your drains, and lower them again a few times. Repeat this 3 or 4 times a day. These exercises help move lymph fluid out of your arm and help restore movement.\n ● You can exercise your affected arm while it’s raised. There are a few ways to do this. With your arm raised, open and close your hand 15 to 25 times. Next, bend and straighten your elbow several times. You can also bend your elbow and touch the shoulder on the same side a few times, then the shoulder on the opposite side a few times. \n ● Practice deep breathing exercises (using your diaphragm) at least 6 times a day. Lie down on your back and take a slow, deep breath. Breathe in as much air as you can while trying to expand your chest and abdomen (push your belly button away from your spine). Relax and breathe out. Repeat this 4 or 5 times. This exercise will help maintain normal movement of your chest, making it easier for your lungs to work. Do deep breathing exercises often Lymphedema management: Lymphedema is a common side effect of breast cancer treatment, particularly after lymph node removal or radiation therapy. \n Physical therapists can provide education on self-care techniques, manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging, and exercises to reduce swelling and improve lymphatic flow. Range of motion and strength exercises: Surgery and radiation therapy can cause stiffness and weakness in the affected arm and shoulder. Physical therapists can design individualized exercise programs to improve range of motion, strength, and function. Pain management: Breast cancer treatment can sometimes lead to pain in the chest, shoulder, or arm. Physical therapists can use various techniques such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and modalities like heat or cold therapy to help manage pain. Fatigue management: Cancer-related fatigue is a common symptom experienced by breast cancer patients. Physical therapists can provide guidance on energy conservation techniques, pacing strategies, and graded exercise programs to help manage fatigue and improve overall energy levels. Scar management: Surgery for breast cancer often leaves scars that can affect t issue mobility and cause discomfort. Physical therapists can provide scar massage techniques, stretching exercises, and other interventions to improve scar mobility and reduce pain or tightness.</string>
